# PLMCollection
Popular Protein Language Models based on Pytorch

## Installation (Linux)

All Python dependencies are specified in `environment.yml`. For producing sequence 
alignments, you'll also need `kalign`, the [HH-suite](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite), 
and one of {`jackhmmer`, [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2) (nightly build)} 
installed on on your system. You'll need `git-lfs` to download OpenFold parameters. 
Finally, some download scripts require `aria2c` and `aws`.

For convenience, we provide a script that installs Miniconda locally, creates a 
`conda` virtual environment, installs all Python dependencies, and downloads
useful resources, including both sets of model parameters. Run:

```bash
scripts/install_third_party_dependencies.sh
```

To activate the environment, run:

```bash
source scripts/activate_conda_env.sh
```

To deactivate it, run:

```bash
source scripts/deactivate_conda_env.sh
```

With the environment active, compile OpenFold's CUDA kernels with

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

To install the HH-suite to `/usr/bin`, run

```bash
# scripts/install_hh_suite.sh
```
